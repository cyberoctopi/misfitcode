*** Sequence Generators
**** collections
     calling seq on a collection or through some sor of seq processing function
***** vector
***** hash-set
***** hash-map
***** PersistentQueue
***** list
**** (custom) usually lazy-seq
     sequence is created over a specialized view, i/o or nested structure
***** nested collection -> tree-seq
***** xml/parsing -> xml-seq
***** files -> file-seq
***** JDBC Results -> resultset-seq
***** BufferedReader -> line-seq
***** regexes -> re-seq
**** on demand
     data in the sequence doesn't exist, it's generated as requested
***** range
***** iterate
***** cycle
***** repeat
**** styling
***** reversed -> rseq
***** blocking -> seque
**** abstractions
     collections offer access through an abstraction?? 'java.util.ArrayList'? COME BACK TO THIS!!!
***** enumeration-seq
***** iterator-seq
****** ArrayList
****** HashSet
***** Another seq
